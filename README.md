Integration of [Forvo](http://forvo.com) pronunciation dictionary into [Duolingo](http://duolingo.com). A truly untested and undocumented extension for the newest Chrome browsers.


## Usage

Install it into a decent Chrome-based browser. It inserts an additional button into the user interface of almost all practice challenges on Duolingo. That button enables the playback of a native speaker pronunciation of the given expression, provided by Forvo.


## Warning

This extension heavily relies on front-end technologies used by Forvo and Duolingo. It is very likely to crash when one of these sites changes its client side behavior or markup structure. This project is only an experiment and it should not be used in any product.
